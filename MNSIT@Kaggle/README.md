######  This project corresponds to [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
The Notebook(mnist_CNN) is based on CNN architecture along with Maxpooling and achieves a Public Score of **0.98542**.It is implemented in Keras.
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/mightylazybones/mnist?scriptVersionId=16853877) is the corresponding kaggle kernel .

The Notebook (mnist_CNNv7) is an improvement. It achieves a Public Score of **0.99200**. It uses dropout method to avoid overfitting. 

The python scripts demonstrate the use of ScikitLearn APIs.
